A Python-based project for performing topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on text data, including preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization. The pipeline supports unigram, bigram, and trigram topic modeling, with coherence evaluation and word cloud generation for each model. The code is designed for Greek text processing, but can be adapted for other languages by modifying the stopword list.

Key Features:

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, bigram/trigram generation).
- Topic modeling using Gensim's LDA.
- Coherence score evaluation for model quality assessment.
- Visualizations with word clouds and pyLDAvis for model insights.
- Output of results as text files and HTML visualizations.
